<h1 align="center">MoonPhaseInfo+</h1>

Displays the following info on top or bottom right side of the screen in-game:
- Small image of the current phase of the moon
- Moon size %
- Up/down arrow indicating if moon size is increasing or decreasing.
- How much time is left until the next moon phase.


Helpful when you need slimeballs and want to go to a swamp biome.

## Config:

The mod generates a small config that allows you to pick where the badge renders:

```ruby
#MoonPhaseInfoPlus config - You can pick between 'top' and 'bottom_right' for the location of the indicator.
#Tue Jan 03 18:35:56 CET 2023
location=bottom_right
```

The available locations are `top` and `bottom_right` (default).
